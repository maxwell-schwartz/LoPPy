Logical Parsing with Python

Beginnings of an attempt to write a Prolog-esque Python library. 

Ultimate Goal: Write a parser to determine if a (simple) sentence is (syntactically) grammatical. This is, admittedly, a lofty goal, and one that is unlikely to actually be fully completed. But it will serve as a good foundatation for this project as it develops.
